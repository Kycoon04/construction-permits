HTML5,CSS with Boostrap, programming IV quiz, recreating a web page for an Municipality.
 
## Information
This system is created to manage municipal services. Its main function is to provide citizens with the ability to request construction permits through a form.
The code consists of three pages: a home page about municipal services, a page explaining the service and its construction requirements, and another with the form to make the request.

The graphic design is supported by tools and styles provided by [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/ ). Additionally, validations are used by JavaScript.

The construction permit is based on the [form permit](https://www.desamparados.go.cr/es/tramites/plataforma/requisitos-permisos-de-construccion) Municipality of Desamparados, Costa Rica.
